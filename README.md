# Match Pairs Demo

Unity demo of a **matching cards game** featuring persistent high scores and the ability to resume previous game sessions. 

The initial screen displays a prompt to enter a **player name**. If the player had previously left in the middle of a game, the same session will be loaded, otherwise a new game begins. After finishing a game, if the final score was that player's best score, it is saved in the leaderboard alongside the time and number of moves taken to finish.
